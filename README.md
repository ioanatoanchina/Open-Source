This represents the repository where are stored all the plot results of the simulations. The results are categorized per airspace area and indicator. There are five big sections namely:
- Airspace Overview
- Dynamic Density
- Controller Workload
- Fractal Dimension
- CO2 Emissions

For each section, different indicators are displayed. The plots are made by using the library _plotly_.


Note! If there are any issues opening the plots, a download will solve the problem.
